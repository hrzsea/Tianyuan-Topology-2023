Title: Progress on the study of Gauged linear Sigma models

Abstract: Gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) proposed by Witten nearly thirty years ago was used to ex- plain the mirror symmetry phenomena. GLSM relates to many important conjectures, like Landau- Ginzburg A model mirror to Landau-Ginzburg B model, Calabi-Yau model to Landau-Ginzburg model correspondence. GLSM has also in􏰇mate rela􏰇on with GIT and can also be formulated in category theory. This report gives a short survey on the recent progress on this topic.
